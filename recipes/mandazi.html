    <h1>Mandazi Recipe</h1>
  <img class="img" src="R.jpeg" alt="Mandazi Photo">
  <p>Mandazi are deep-fried, spiced doughnut-like treats that are an East African delicacy. These fluffy and fragrant bites are great for snacking, but be forewarned, it's virtually impossible to eat just one! Our mandazi recipe is made with simple pantry staples like flour, sugar, baking powder, and coconut milk. They are triangle-shaped and flavored with a dash of cardamom, which infuses a unique taste, setting them apart from American doughnuts. Mandazi are best served with a cup of hot Kenyan coffee or chai and are perfect for breakfast. Serve them with honey or jam for a sweet treat, or enjoy them with curry.

  <h2>Ingredients for Mandazi</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>½ cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cardamom</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>13 ½ oz coconut milk, 1 can</li>
    <li>oil, for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Preparations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cardamom, and salt. Make a well in the center, then use a rubber spatula to mix in the egg and coconut milk until the dough comes together.
    </li>
    <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Dive the dough into 4 portions. Roll out 1 portion of dough into a circle about ¼-inch (6 ml) thick. Cut into 8 triangles. Repeat with the remaining dough portions.
    </li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C).
    </li>
    <li>Working in batches, fry the mandazi for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve as breakfast or a snack with Kenyan coffee or chai.</li>
